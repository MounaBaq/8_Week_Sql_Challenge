## Business Task
Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## üßº Data Cleaning & Transformation

Looking at the `customer_orders` table below, we can see that there are
- In the `exclusions` column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values. 
- In the `extras` column, there are missing/ blank spaces ' ' and null values.

Our course of action to clean the table:
- Create a temporary table with all the columns
- Remove null values in `exlusions` and `extras` columns and replace with blank space ' '.

````sql
  select order_id,customer_id,pizza_id,order_time,
  case 
  when exclusions is null or exclusions like 'null' then ' ' else exclusions
  END AS exclusions,
  iif((extras is NULL) or (extras like 'null'), ' ', extras) as extras
  INTO #customer_orders -- create TEMP TABLE
  FROM customer_orders
````

This is how the clean `customers_orders_temp` table looks like and we will use this table to run all our queries.
